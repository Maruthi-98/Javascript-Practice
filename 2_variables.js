// Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

// example 1:

//In this example First_name, Last_name are variables, declared with the var keyword:

var First_name = "G";

var Last_name = "Maruthi"

console.log(First_name);
console.log(Last_name);

var num1 = 10; // we can even store numbers and boolean values decimal values and many other values in variable

console.log(num1);


// example 2:

//In this example Full_name are variables, declared with the let  keyword:

let Full_name ="G Maruthi";

console.log(Full_name);

//example 3:
// In this example PI are variables, declared with the const  keyword:
// variable declared with const cannot be changed

const PI = 3.14  

//PI = 3.10  // trying to change the value in const variable but the results are ERROR - "Assignment to constant variable."

console.log(PI);
