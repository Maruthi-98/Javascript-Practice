let first_Name_Number = Number(first_Name);
console.log( typeof first_Name_Number);  // typeof will help us find what type of data  it is and if we console.log(first_Name_Number)  it will return NaN because Maruthi is not a number


let age = 25;  // it is a number. Now lets convert it in to string

let age_string = String(age);  // number has been successfully converted using string()

console.log(typeof age_string);
